<p>Read the two papers mentioned in <a href="/dendron-blogs/notes/5qc6azxgb81f9x50y8z84ui">2023-02-01</a> over the weekend. Very unproductive on Sunday. But I needed a break.</p>
<h1 id="school"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#school"></a>School</h1>
<p>Group meeting for data visualization. Done my other reports and stuff. The interactive machine learning professors promised to reply my email last week. Yet, I've heard nothing back from them. I have to start working on it no matter what. Because my chores are piling up.</p>
<h1 id="research"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#research"></a>Research</h1>
<p>No progress whatsoever.</p>
