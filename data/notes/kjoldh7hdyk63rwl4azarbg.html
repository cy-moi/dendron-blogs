<p>Get <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels">VSCode Tunnel</a> up and running today. It is mindblowingly easy to use! So powerful! It turns every device into a fully functioned PC immediately as long as it has a browser. I love Web!</p>
<p>Took my CG test in the afternoon. Clicked on the wrong choice for one. Ugh! This body never functions the way ordered by the brain. I know I should've got rid of it (not really).</p>
<p>Passed out after I fixed myself some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dry_noodles">noodles (Re Gan Mian)</a> at about 8pm. Woke up at 11 in the horror of not getting any research done today. Found this <a href="https://finnhub.io/">website</a> actually hosts the SEC filings for free with APIs. They also uploaded t<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/finnhub/sec-filings?resource=download">hese nice datasets</a> for bulk downloading SEF filings. Anyway, downloaded some of the datasets to my google drive first with colab scripts. My steam deck work station does not have enough local disk for them. But the raw 10-X data is way too large even for google drive free limit. I am looking at <a href="https://www.scaleway.com/en/">Scaleway</a>. Not sure if it is really free.</p>
