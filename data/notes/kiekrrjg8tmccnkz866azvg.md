I fell on the bus yesterday and sit on my yogurt today. Show me some luck please.

Implemented rnn to score text embeddings with tfjs. I do not think my professors like me. But the code works either way.

And I think ChatGPT produces some bad codes that would delay my work even worse. I guess I better depend on my own codes. Like copilot, I am so easily misguided, so not entitled to use these tools probably.
