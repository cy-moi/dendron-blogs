<p>Discussed new design with Prof. I decided to completely remove permission management from the design at all. A drastical change, but as he implied, the version control solves permission management problem naturally.</p>
<p>Technically, I think webstrates + nodegit would work, no other frameworks required. I will use indexdb to test the solution first. I do not know how long it would take to get it work. Time is such a precious thing to me. I have five projects awaiting for implementations in two weeks. </p>
<p>For the <a href="/dendron-blogs/notes/isi9qi80jvtfqv94g6cmv93">Universal Particles</a>, I was told to implement the rigid body and spring contraints only. I have not yet finished this week's lab. Will do it tomorrow after getting the literature review of <em>interactive <a href="/dendron-blogs/notes/e15sw2ol9d3xec39qk81p4z">NLP</a> model builder</em> done for interactive machine learning class.</p>
