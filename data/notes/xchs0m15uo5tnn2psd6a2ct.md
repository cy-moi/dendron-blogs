# My CG Knowledge Base

It is hard to remember all the CG knowledge, especially when I am not actively using any of them right now. Here, I backup some interesting things regarding CG and animations. 

It is nice to know there are many [CG internships](https://www.asso-afig.fr/site/offres/), thanks to [Professor Rohmer](https://imagecomputing.net/damien.rohmer/) for [X-INF585](https://imagecomputing.net/damien.rohmer/teaching/inf585/index.html). I am taking my notes for this class at [[Computer Graphics.X-INF585 Notes]] as well.

My previous education on computer graphics including learning with basic knowledge from Professor Jarek Rossignac and Professor Karen Liu's [computer graphics classes](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jarek/lectures/), computer aesthetics class, and [computer animation class](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/classes/AY2012/cs4496_spring/Home.html).
