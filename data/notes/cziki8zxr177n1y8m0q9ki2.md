Learn advanced stuff related to postion based dynamics to universal solvers. I was not particularly good at this topic, but it is super cool!

I've always been interested in [this paper](https://mmacklin.com/uppfrta_preprint.pdf).

Today is the day I am gonna implement it.

The deadline is 3 weeks away.

Some implementation I found:

[CUDA + openGL physics engine](https://github.com/jamornsriwasansak/brass-pan)

[Particel Solver](https://github.com/ebirenbaum/ParticleSolver)
