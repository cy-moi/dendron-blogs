Read the two papers mentioned in [[Chores.journal.2023.02.01]] over the weekend. Very unproductive on Sunday. But I needed a break.

# School

Group meeting for data visualization. Done my other reports and stuff. The interactive machine learning professors promised to reply my email last week. Yet, I've heard nothing back from them. I have to start working on it no matter what. Because my chores are piling up.

# Research

No progress whatsoever.
