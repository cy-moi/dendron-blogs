Jesus, how many days have I not updated my journals?

Today's little thought: I wonder how many people use another workspace to draft and play with components. I find myself doing it very commonly. It is hard to always keep up the style and the regulation of a large project. So I have some local playground where I can just quickly test out algorithms or new packages without tampering with the important stuff. 

# School

Did some cloth algorithm for my graphics lab today! 

Made a simple cloud pie chart with svg clipping path after coming back home.

# Research

Working on the low-fi prototype.

I desperately need the SSD disk for my steam deck which I am using as my main work station. 64G is not enough at all. I ran out of space three times over the weekend!
