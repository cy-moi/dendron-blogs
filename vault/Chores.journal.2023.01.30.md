## School
Boring. Sent an email to argue for a better grade. Mission impossible; did it anyway.

## Research
Fine-gained permission management system stalled a little bit. I shall find time to talk with Prof. Michel and Prof. James Eagan.

Finance word list is pushing on track. Some ideas nailed and seem promising. Datasets hunt went well, marked in Kaggle. More work to do: [[Notes with My Mate.todolist]].
