Discussed new design with Prof. I decided to completely remove permission management from the design at all. A drastical change, but as he implied, the version control solves permission management problem naturally.

Technically, I think webstrates + nodegit would work, no other frameworks required. I will use indexdb to test the solution first. I do not know how long it would take to get it work. Time is such a precious thing to me. I have five projects awaiting for implementations in two weeks. 

For the [[Computer Graphics.universal particles]], I was told to implement the rigid body and spring contraints only. I have not yet finished this week's lab. Will do it tomorrow after getting the literature review of _interactive [[NLP]] model builder_ done for interactive machine learning class.
