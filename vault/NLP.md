Time to learn some NLP knowledge.

Jan. [[Chores.journal.2023.01.30]], 2023

 Currently working on [tensorflow.js](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs) and NLP models. I forked [marcelle.js](https://marcelle.dev) and added some components for language encoders and huggingface model api support at [here](https://github.com/cy-moi/marcelle/tree/0.0.6-sentence-encoder).

 Working on the literature review of an interactive machine learning process for producing automatic short text grading (ASAG/AEG?).
