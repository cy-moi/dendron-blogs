Our recent topic: textual analysis on Finance and the McDonald word list and NLP.

I am surpised at how finance people are doing their textual analysis. Of course, all the filings are extremely useful albeit the outdated methods. 

[This AWS paper is pretty nice.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405918821000131) Yet,
my mate said it failed to provide insights on how this would help finding returns. Apparently, the returns are more important than methods to come up with better word lists.

Here are more to read for me to understand how textual analysis works in finance:

[Some lit review on advanced textual analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405918822000046)

[Another important work from McDonald](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2504147)

I also have to start working on gathering datasets and data cleaning.
